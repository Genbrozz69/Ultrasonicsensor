## Basic Details
### Team Name: Genbrozz


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Ivan Christopher-TKM College Of Engineering
- Member 2: Aadil Ajeev-TKM College Of Engineering
- Member 3: Gokul Shaji-TKM College Of Engineering

### Project Description
An Object detection tool using Arduino Uno and Ultrasonic Sensor.The components used are Led,Arduino Uno,Buzzer,Jumper wires,Breadboard,Ultrasonic Sensor,Resistors.
Can be useful in finding blind spots and for blind people.It can also be  used for various purposes like car parking system etc.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Constant Beeping with/without any objects

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
By using a ultrasonic sensor,object detection can be implemented

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- C++

For Hardware:
- Ultrasonic sensor
- Arduino uno
- Led
- Buzzer
- Breadboard
- Jumperwire
- Resistor

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
Arduino IDE

# Run
pinMode
digitalWrite
pulseIn{Functions used}

Run the code in Arduino IDE and use the following functions carefully
Connect the Arduino circuit to laptop or external power supply to see the result
note:When external supply is connected make sure it will not exceed the threshold voltage.

A 5v supply is connected to breadboard and ground also connected
a led with a 27 ohm resistor is connected to positive 5 volt and negative of led is grounded.

### Project Demo
https://drive.google.com/file/d/17lrXcpo1HdYSvPurVVPNfvIsY01ki4fw/view?usp=drive_link

When a supply of 5v is provided ,The Ultrasonic sensor gets activated and it detects objects and if the distance is less than 20 cm,The buzzer gets activated and will start beeping.The Led along with it will also blink.
